1.What do you mean by an array?
:-An array is a data structure in programming that allows you to store multiple elements of the same data type in a single variable. It provides a way to access and manipulate a collection of values using a single identifier.

2.How to create an array?
:-int[] arr = new int[size];

3.Can we change the size of an array at runtime?
:-In many programming languages like Java, the size of an array is fixed once it's created and cannot be changed at runtime. You would need to create a new array if you need a different size.

4.Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
:-In some programming languages, like JavaScript, you can declare an array without specifying its size. The size will dynamically adjust as you add or remove elements.

5.What is the default value of an array?
:-In many programming languages, the default value for numeric arrays is usually 0, while for reference types (like objects), it's often null.

6.What is a 1D array with an example?
:-int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

7.write a program of 2d array?
:-
public class TwoDArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
